# Airbnb Clone Project

## [AirbnbClone](https://airbnbclone22.netlify.app/)

Here are some key features of this web application:

1. Accommodation Search: Users can search for accommodations by entering their desired location, travel dates, and other filters such as price range, room type, amenities, and more. The search results display available listings based on the specified criteria.

2. Listing Creation: Property owners can create listings by providing detailed information about their accommodations, including photos, descriptions, amenities, pricing, and availability. They can also set house rules and specify any additional services or experiences they offer.

3. Booking and Reservation Management: Users can view available listings, select their desired accommodation, and proceed to book it for their chosen dates. Once a booking is confirmed, users can manage their reservations, view booking details, communicate with the host, and make payments. (not yet implemented)

4. User Profiles: Users have personalized profiles that display their information, verified identities, and previous reviews. Hosts can showcase their properties and manage their listings, while guests can view their booking history and leave reviews for their past stays.

5. Wishlists and Saved Searches: Users can create wishlists to save their favorite listings for future reference. They can also save their search criteria to receive notifications when new listings match their preferences.
